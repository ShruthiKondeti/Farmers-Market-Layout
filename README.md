# Farmers-Market-Layout
Design of a farmers market layout using python

Here I have considered a 15,000 sqft land, with 10 shops.
Each shop is of 1000 sqft

The users for this application are:
1. Farmer
2. Customer

Farmer:
He/She adds the shop and its details.
He can occupy one among the 10 shops in first come first serve basis.
After 10 shops, there will be no availability

The details of the shops are stored in Json file.

Customer:
The customer will be just able to see the details of the shops in the market.
This details is fetched from the Json file to display it to the customer
